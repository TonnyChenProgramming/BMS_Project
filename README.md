# Battery Management System (FreeRTOS + STM32 + WiFi)
A real-time Battery Management System implemented on the STM32F407 Discovery board using FreeRTOS. This system continuously samples voltage, current, and temperature; computes state of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH); detects faults; updates an OLED display; and transmits data over UART in JSON format.
